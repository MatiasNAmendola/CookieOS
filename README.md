What is CookieOS?
=================
CookieOS is a basic and small UNIX-like operating system that is currently 
in its ***very*** early stages of development.

What will CookieOS be?
------------------------
In the future, I hope to implement the following features into CookieOS:

* Multitasking
* Filesystem support
* Modular microkernel
* VGA
* Simple GUI
